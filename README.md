# Calculator Project

About The Project:

This project is the first project in the frame of the programming course “Introduction to scientific programming with Python” at the University of Siegen. The project was created to evaluate how students comprehend and use the knowledge they receive during the lectures and practical seminars. 

The task was to develop a calculator app with 3 types of calculators:

1. Basic: it can perform the basic operations (+,-, x,÷) on two input numbers.
2. Scientific: it can perform the basic operations and sqrt, power, sin, cos.
3. Advanced: it can perform multiple basic operations on multiple input numbers. 
For each calculator, a specific class was supposed to be created. In this particular work, the advanced calculator is created without using classes. 

Build With:

PyCharm // Lectures from Amir Tosson (University of Siegen) // Google

How to use:

Open the calculator.py file in PyCharm or another IDE to run the calculator.
