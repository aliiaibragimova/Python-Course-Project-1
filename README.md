# Python Couse. Project 1

About The Project 

This project is the first project in the frame of the programming course “Introduction to scientific programming with Python” at the University of Siegen. The project was created to evaluate how students comprehend and use the knowledge they receive during the lectures and practical seminars. 

The task was to develop 3 types of calculators:

1. Basic: it can perform the basic operations (+,-, x,÷) on two input numbers.
2. Scientific: it can perform the basic operations and sqrt, power, sin, cos.
3. Advanced: it can perform multiple basic operations on multiple input numbers. 

In this specific case the advanced calculator differs from the original task: it allows to perform additional calculations to a previously obtained result. 

Build With

PyCharm // Lectures from Amir Tosson (University of Siegen) // Google
 
Usage

All three calculators can be used to perform basic mathematical operations on two input numbers and the advanced calculator 2 can perform multiple basic operations on multiple input numbers.
